        Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`,
        return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.
        The order of numbers in the combinations matters.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): List of distinct positive integers.
            target (int): Target sum to be formed.

        Returns:
            int: Number of permutations that sum to `target`.
